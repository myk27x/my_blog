      <h2>You read it right... the internet has broken...</h2>
        <p>
            In this day and age, everything runs on the internet. In 2014, 56% of people surveyed actually preferred shopping online to visiting physical store, but then that is this age. I'm sure you all remember <strong><em>walking</em></strong> to the corner market for a loaf of bread, ordering the newest "_________" from your (magazine) using your corded home telephone, or waiting for a slew of birthday cards to show up in the mail boasting funny green pieces of paper called money. Those things are all relics of the past. Online food ordering with delivery from the local grocery store, downloading the newest and best software the second it releases instead of standing in line and hoping they still have a copy when it's your turn, and quirky online birthday cards from people you don't even know plastered all over your social media page (no more 'cash', but maybe you'll get a paypal deposit or an e-gift card that can be scanned in store using your smart phone). The internet has broken much... my how the times have changed...

      <h3>Out with the old...</h3>
        <p>
          Change is always inevitable and highly feared. Most of the youth of today will never know how long this technology took to get to where it is today. Yet, through all of the trials and tribulations of the internet they do have quite a bit to be thankful for:
          <ol>
            <li> First and foremost, never having to hear <a href="https://www.dialupsound.com/">this</a> ever... ever again...</li>
            <li> You can find something on <a href="www.google.com">Google<a/> faster than you can even <em>find</em> a card catalog.</li>
            <li> ...and lastly... this: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LH5ay10RTGY"/><img height = "42px" width = "75px" src="http://www.jaydelovell.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ask-me-about-my-banana-300x168.jpg" title="You must touch my banana... you MUST!"></a></li>
          </ol>
          The youth today will never be able to appreciate life without technology like many others have (myself included), nor can they appreciate where technology has taken this world.
        </p>
      <h4>The only fear left...</h4>
        <p>
          The internet has made everything move faster, and faster, and faster. A speeding train that has no restrictions. Full speed ahead. Warp 10! Then turn it up to 11! Every day the speed of information increases the speed of the world just a little more. It used to be that technological breakthroughs would be fewer and far between. First years. Then months. Now it seems that there is something new once a week. The only fear left... is being left behind... and that the internet, one day, might break...
